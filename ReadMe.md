#H1 Rick and Morty LoL Announcer Pack mod
This is a bundle of the Unreal Mod LoL announcer mod with an added Rick and Morty Announcer Pack that was adapted from DotA 2

1. open __Unreal Tournament Mod.exe__, should have the Rick and Morty pack in the soundpacks folder
2. set the language in the mod to match your current region, if you do not do this the mod will not be able to find your lol.launcher.exe location
3. set the path on the mod to the location of your lol.launcher.exe, read above step.
4. choose an announcer pack to use, this bundle comes with the Rick and Morty announcer pack and the Unreal Tournament announcer pack.
  * Look for more packs at the [LoL Announcer Mods](https://www.facebook.com/AnnouncerMods) facebook page.
  * Dump any new packs into the __Soundpacks__ folder.
5. Hit __Patch__ on the mod.
6. Go into a bot game to see if it works.

#H5 If you have any issues with this working check __logs/current.log__ with any text viewing file to see what happened!
